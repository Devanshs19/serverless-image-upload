A 100% free-tier, fully functional serverless web application that allows users to:

-Upload images directly from the browser to an S3 bucket
-Preview images before upload
-View the public URL after upload
-Automatically trigger an AWS Lambda function on every new upload
-Use event-driven architecture with S3 → Lambda
-No backend server / no EC2 / no hosting costs — purely serverless
